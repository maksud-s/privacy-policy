<h1>Privacy Policy - I Am Busy Now</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy outlines how <strong>I Am Busy Now</strong> (the "App"), developed by <strong>The Mystery Lens</strong> (<a href="https://aimoneymake.com">aimoneymake.com</a>), collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated: June 26, 2025</strong></p>

<h2>1. Information We Access and Collect (Limited)</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>I Am Busy Now</strong> App is designed to provide specific call management functionality. To achieve this, it requires access to certain device information and capabilities. We want to be clear about what information is accessed and for what purposes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Device Phone State:</strong> The App accesses your device's phone state (e.g., ringing, idle, off-hook) to detect incoming calls and manage their status (i.e., making your phone appear busy to the caller). We do not store your call logs or the content of your calls.</li>
  <li><strong>Device Identifiers (via Third-Party Advertising):</strong> The App integrates Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect certain device identifiers (such as Android Advertising ID, IP address, and other unique identifiers) and app usage data (e.g., app interactions, crash logs, diagnostics) to serve personalized ads and for analytics purposes. This data is collected and processed according to Google's Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How Your Information Is Used</h2>
<p>The limited information accessed by the App is used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To enable the core functionality of Busy Mode, allowing the App to detect and automatically send a busy signal to incoming calls when activated.</li>
  <li>To display relevant advertisements through Google AdMob, which helps support the continued development and maintenance of the App.</li>
  <li>For internal analytics (via AdMob) to understand app performance, identify issues, and improve user experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>
<p>To perform its functions, the App requests the following permissions. These permissions are accessed only when necessary for the described functionality:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE:</strong> To detect the status of incoming calls (e.g., when the phone is ringing).</li>
  <li><strong>android.permission.ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS:</strong> Used in conjunction with call management functionalities to influence the state of incoming calls.</li>
  <li><strong>android.permission.CALL_PHONE:</strong> For programmatically managing call states and potentially affecting call routing (e.g., to send a busy signal).</li>
  <li><strong>android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE:</strong> To allow the App to run a service in the background that continuously monitors phone state and manages calls, even when the App's user interface is closed. This service displays a persistent notification to inform you that it is active.</li>
  <li><strong>android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_PHONE_CALL:</strong> (For Android 9 and above) A specific type of foreground service permission for apps that handle phone calls in the background.</li>
  <li><strong>android.permission.MODIFY_PHONE_STATE:</strong> Used for more advanced control over phone state, including actions related to call handling (e.g., ending calls). <strong>This is a highly sensitive permission.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>android.permission.INTERNET:</strong> To connect to the internet for loading advertisements and checking for app updates.</li>
  <li><strong>android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> To check the current network connectivity status before attempting network operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>These permissions are used solely for the functionality described above and in accordance with Google Play Store policies.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services (Google AdMob)</h2>
<p>
  This App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> for displaying advertisements. AdMob is an advertising service provided by Google.
  AdMob's use of data is governed by Google's Privacy Policy. Please refer to
  <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for more details on how Google collects, processes, and uses data from services like AdMob.
  You may be able to opt out of personalized advertising by visiting your device's ad settings (e.g., Android Settings > Google > Ads).
</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention and Security</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>I Am Busy Now</strong> App does not store your personal call logs, contacts, or other sensitive personal information on its servers or on your device beyond what is necessary for immediate app functionality and advertising via AdMob.
  We implement reasonable security measures to protect the integrity and security of the limited data accessed. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
  Since the App primarily operates on-device and does not collect or store your direct personal identifiers (like name, email, phone number, contacts, or messages), direct data access or deletion requests through us for App-specific data are generally not applicable. For data collected by third-party services like AdMob, please refer to their respective privacy policies for your rights and how to exercise them (e.g., Google's privacy policy for AdMob data).
</p>

<h2>7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>I Am Busy Now</strong> App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
</p>
